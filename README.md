“Bin-centive”, propounds an eminently scalable solution that integrates android application and web portal to encourage the usage of bins and promotes the “Swachh Bharat” mission. The incentive mechanism uses android application and SMS services, instead of printed tokens, so as to promote the idea of “Digital India”.

The prototype proposes dual compartment system which provides incentives to the user based on type and quantity of waste dumped. The android application will be proffered to the citizens along with the collectors. Citizens will be directed to the nearest bin according to their type of waste and will be provided with incentives accordingly, which can be redeemed using the android application/SMS/printed token. Another advantage of app would be to help citizens segregate their waste for disposal using the ML model integrated. Collectors will be provided with an optimized route for collection of waste from filled bins. A bin can also be flagged to require maintenance, by the collectors as well as the citizens, which can further be managed by the authority using Web portal.

The web portal deals with the real time tracking of collectors, report generation and analysis based of type and frequency of waste generated in an area, and is primarily accessible to authorities only.
